## Configuration

This application is storing the configuration of the environment in a `.env` file, it uses the principles behind a [twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/).

You can find an example of this file in the [.env.example](https://github.com/jveillet/tentacles-dashboard/blob/master/.env.example).

### GitHub App

You will first need need to create a GitHub app. Instructions are described in the [Creating a GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app/) documentation page.

Copy the GitHub client Id and secrets into the `.env`.

```bash
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_app_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_app_client_secret
```

### Database

Generate a random secret for the database password and put them in the `.env`.

```bash
# Test and Dev
TENTACLES_DEV_DATABASE_PASSWORD=random_string_secret
# Production
TENTACLES_DATABASE_PASSWORD=random_string_secret
```

You will also need to add the needded PostgreSQL env variables for athtentication:

```bash
PGHOST=localhost
PGUSER=postgres
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=same_as_TENTACLES_DEV_DATABASE_PASSWORD
```

### GraphQL Schema

This project uses GitHub's [GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/).
To (re)generate the GraphQL schema, you will need to create a personal access token on GitHub.
Instruction are described in the [Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) documentation page.

Add this personnal token named `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` into the `.env`.

Then request a newer version of the schema using rails:

```bash
bundle exec rails schema:update
```

## Installing

```bash
yarn install
bundle install
```

## Database initialisation

```bash
bundle exec rails db:create
bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

## Usage

The server is available by default on the port 3000.

```bash
bundle exec rails s -p 3000 -b '0.0.0.0'
```

To access the app in your local browser, go to `http://localhost:3000`.

In development mode, you also need to launch the webpack dev server:

```bash
./bin/webpack-dev-server
```

The webpack dev server will run on the 3035 port.

## Docker

In development, you can use Docker and `docker-compose` to bootstrap the project. The `Dockerfile` contains everything
needed to install and launched Tentacles.

The `docker-compose.yml` contains all the configuration:

* A web container (the Web App).
* A Redis conainer (for cache).
* A PostgreSQL container (for storing mostly the users and preferences).
* A Webpack Dev Server (to use webpack with hot reloading).

### Install

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### Usage

```bash
docker-compose up
```

To access the app in your local browser, go to `http://localhost:3000`.

The webpack dev server will run on the 3035 port.

## Tests

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```
